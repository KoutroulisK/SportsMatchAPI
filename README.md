# Matches REST API

## Introduction
This is a basic REST API which offers CRUD functionality in order to manage data for a sport match along with its odds. It has been built with JAVA and Spring Boot and utilizes PostgreSQL for its database needs.

A Postman collection with request examples and the schema of the PostgreSQL database are included.
